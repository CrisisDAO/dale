### Captain's Log

Vessel: Crisis

> **Remarks onboard Saturday, August 14th, 2021, sometime in the PM**

> After weeks of exchanging boring messages about yacht repair on the BAYC bathroom, I found a mechanic to fix the engine knocking. When he finally showed his hairy ass, he pulled a bottle of Gorilla Glue out of his pocket and headed to the engine room. I sense monkey business, but I believe that the almighty Eth will keep me afloat. This morning as I was preparing to take Crisis out for her new-to-me maiden voyage, I noticed tendrils of purple smoke casually drifting along the deck. It smells a little like boxed wine. I'll take that as a good omen. Sadly, I had to trade my kennel club dog that was gifted to me by the BAYC for the repairs. She was my only hand-on-deck and very close to becoming a faithful companion. As soon as I find the Mysterious Note, I plan to use my bounty to get her back if the floor doesn't rise. BAYC port. Meh weather. Ready to throw off the bowlines. -Dale
